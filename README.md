- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mr-zcm
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to script in Python, building my own VM's for practice hacking, as well as having a better foundation and understanding of the Linux OS. I also will be exploring videogame development, and plan on publishing projects on here.
- :left_speech_bubble: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on how to advance my understanding and skills at hacking to get into the career field as an Ethical Hacker / Bug Bounty Hunter
